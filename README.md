# Flood-Damage-Prediction
Project Overview
This project aims to predict the damage caused by floods in different states of India using historical flood data. The predictions focus on damage metrics such as area affected, crop loss, and human lives lost over a period from 1953 to 2021. By leveraging machine learning models, we aim to assist in disaster preparedness and resource allocation for flood relief efforts.

Data Description
The dataset used in this project includes:

State-wise flood damage data from 1953 to 2021.
Key features:
Year: The year the flood occurred.
State: The affected state in India.
Area affected (in hectares).
Crop damage (in millions of rupees).
Human lives lost.
Total damage (estimated in financial terms).
Data was sourced from government databases and other reliable sources.

METHODOLOGY
Considering annual trends, state-wise and damage patterns, prediction models projecting the impacts of damage due 
to floods during the next forty years, attempts are also made in this study. Year-by-year data checks were easily done 
with Linear regression and found to provide good forecasts for a number of damage categories. 
It also carried out a further district-by-district inquiry into the flood damage that Assam has been undergoing over the 
last five years, which has also come out with various results that focus on gradient boosting as one of the best for 
accurate predictions in this area. 
Historical flood data is used when integrating machine learning algorithms in the estimation of future risks. The 
approach assures that the pressing need in India for better flood management techniques is met by enhancing 
preparedness and resilience in those affected areas.

Results
Accuracy: The model achieved an [98% accuracy] in predicting overall flood damage.
Key Insights:
Flood damage has increased significantly in certain regions over time.
Crop loss is one of the most affected variables, with an upward trend observed.
The random forest model provided the best balance of accuracy and interpretability.
Future Work
Improve model accuracy by using more sophisticated models like neural networks.
Incorporate additional features such as rainfall data, river levels, or soil moisture to improve predictions.
Expand the dataset to include global flood data for broader applicability.
